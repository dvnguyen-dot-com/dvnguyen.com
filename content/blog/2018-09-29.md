**I'll return to this post after learning about functional `partial` in Python**

What can be put as arguments of the `path()` function when defining Django's routes?

The first argument is the route, such as '/' and 'about/' etc.
What to put as the remaining arguments is an interesting case.

For app-wise code, you often use `path(route, view, name, namespace`, such as `path('answers/', views.post_answer, 'post:answer', 'polls'`

But for project-wise code, you'll see the use of `include`: `path('polls/', include('polls.urls')`, or just put an object there: `path('admin/', admin.site.urls)`. In this post, I'll try to explain these syntaxes.

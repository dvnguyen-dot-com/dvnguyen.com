Ideas are cheap, but good ideas are rare.
Generating is not hard if you have an eye for problems. A slightliest itirating problem can lead to a new idea.
What's hard is choosing what idea to pursue.
Time is limited.
Unless the goal of a project is sharpening my skills, I'll only choose the best idea I have to work on.

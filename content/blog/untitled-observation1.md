How diagrams.app gets to HN frontpage?

Today, the link to website diagrams.app gets to the HN page. It's a landing page for an native MacOS diagram app. But there was no app. How it can get to the HN FRONTPAGE?

The author says that he announces to Twitter today, then magic happens.

He had only about 400 followers.

My takes:
- the demand for a diagram app is real. I should start working in my webbased diagram idea.
- 400 followers are enough for validating an idea and getting a small initial boost.
